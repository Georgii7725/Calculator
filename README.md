# Calculator
Project consist of 2 python files. 
In calculate-beta you will find calculator, that can calculates sum, difference, product and quotient of two non-negative nummers in any notation.
In second one (calculate-alfa) there is code, that can do same thing but for two whole numbers

The suumator and the additor were implemented via bitwise computation
The differator, that calculate difference between two numbers, and divider were implemented as finding a results, that satisfies summator or additor.
I mean a - b is c, that satisfies expression c + b = a. Also it was implemented in divider: find c = a / b is find c, that satisfies expression c * b = a
